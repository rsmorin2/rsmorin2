Hello, I'm rsMorin2!
I'm interested in joining a non-profit project to get experience, and in finding 
full time employment as a Java or Web Developer. 
I'm currently learning Android App Development.
I have certifications in Java, Web Development, and Android app development. 

You can reach me at rsmorin2@gmail.com if you would like to collaborate on a project!
